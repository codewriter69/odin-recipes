        <li>Fill a wok or deep frying pan with the oil so it's about ½cm deep, then heat to medium-high. </li>
        <li>Carefully add the chicken in batches, cooking for 3-4 mins, using tongs to turn regularly until golden and crispy. </li>
        <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain.</li>
        <li>Mix together the remaining soy, sweet chilli, garlic paste and sesame oil in a large bowl.
